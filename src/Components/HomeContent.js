                        India has a single integrated judicial system. The judiciary in India has a pyramidal structure with the Supreme Court (SC) at the top. High Courts are below the SC, and below them are the district and subordinate courts. 
                        The lower courts function under the direct superintendence of the higher courts.

                        Apart from the above structure, there are also two branches of the legal system, which are:

Criminal Law: These deal with the committing of a crime by any citizen/entity. A criminal case starts when the local police file a crime report. The court finally decides on the matter.
Civil Law: These deal with disputes over the violation of the Fundamental Rights of a citizen.
Supreme Court has three types of jurisdictions. They are original, appellate and advisory. The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is mentioned in Articles 131, 133, 136 and 143 of the Constitution.
